Welcome to the documentation for kodiaq. If you are a user looking to
install the program and steer a running data acquisition system, look at the
beginning sections on installation and usage of the UI. Devs will want
to delve further into the docs in order to learn how to install a full
deployment.

Our code is hosted on github so be sure to check out the repository
`here <https://github.com/XENON1T/kodiaq.git>`_. You might also be
