Installation of the client UI
==============================

Fetching the source code
-------------------------

Our source code is hosted on `github
<https://github.com/XENON1T/kodiaq>`_. In addition to checking out the
code, you can also use github
to report bugs and issues and keep track of the current development.
The repository is password-protected and an authorized github account
is required for access.

Assuming you have repository access::

    git clone https://github.com/XENON1T/kodiaq.git

You will have to provide your login credentials. This will then create
the file 'kodiaq' in whatever directory you ran the command in. 


Compiling the UI module
------------------------

To build the software: ::

    cd kodiaq
    ./configure
    make

There are a few dependencies required for the user library. You will
need, of course, a compiler and build libraries like make. The UI is
also written in ncurses, so you need libncurses-dev, libtinfo-dev,
libmenu-dev, and libform-dev. On Ubuntu you can install this as
follows: ::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev


Running the code
-----------------

If make completed correctly you should have an executable called
koUser in src/user. The program is run using this executable. There is
a shortcut script in the top-level directory (kodiaq, unless you
changed the name) called kodiaq_client.sh which you can use to run.::

     ./kodiaq_client.sh

The screen size of kodiaq is 132x43 (if you use ubuntu this is an
option in the menu bar of the terminal). You should run with a
terminal at least this large. If your terminal is larger, no problem,
if it's smaller then you just won't be able to see some things.
