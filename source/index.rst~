Welcome to kodiaq - The networked parallel data reader
======================================================

Welcome to the documentation for kodiaq and thank you for your
interest in the project. If you are a user looking to install the
program and steer a running data acquisition system, look under the 
"For Users" section below. Developers looking to get into the 
meat of the program or deploy the entire system should check out the 
"For Devs" section.
