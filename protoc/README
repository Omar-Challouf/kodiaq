Google protocol buffers for file output.

-----------
Compilation
-----------

To compile a class:
protoc -I=./ --cpp_out=./ --python_out=./ FILE.proto

This gives you a c++ class and a python class in the current directory.


-----------------
Rules for Classes
-----------------

Feel free to add ::optional:: fields to the class and recompile.
Please do not add required fields. This maintains backwards
compatibility with previous file formats. Store a copy of the .proto
file used to generate your class in the kodiaq/protoc directory with a
date string indicating when it was created. As a rule, the most recent
class should be compiled into the code.

Probably best not to touch anything in that case. ;-)
